# Execution: Planning Doc Structure Update

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Based on**: User request for lean, 1-page planning template
**Status**: ✅ Completed

---

## Overview

Updated the planning documentation structure from a verbose, comprehensive template to a lean, 1-page format optimized for cross-session continuity and human-agent collaboration.

---

## Task Checklist

### Documentation Updates

- [x] Replace `docs/_active/planning.md` with lean 1-page template
- [x] Create `docs/_active/README.md` explaining doc structure
- [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` with planning workflow guidance
- [x] Create execution doc for this work

---

## Changes Made

### 1. `docs/_active/planning.md` - Complete Rewrite

**Before**: Verbose template with 16 sections including detailed context, alternatives, wireframes, etc.

**After**: Lean 1-page template with 10 core sections:
1. TL;DR (≤3 bullets)
2. Goals / Non-Goals
3. Scope (In / Out)
4. Architecture (1 paragraph + ASCII)
5. Contract Snapshot (stable bits only)
6. Risks & Mitigations (Top 3)
7. Decisions Log (table with dates & 1-way/2-way flags)
8. Open Questions (with owners & due dates)
9. Success Metrics
10. Timeline (plan, not commitment)

**Key improvement**: Deep details moved to optional annexes (linked only when needed)

### 2. `docs/_active/README.md` - New File

Created comprehensive guide explaining:
- Core documents (planning.md vs execution.md)
- Annex structure (`docs/features/[feature-name]/`)
- When to create annexes (context, models, diagrams, telemetry, security, runbook)
- Workflow for agents & humans (starting features, during implementation, cross-session handoff)
- Benefits and anti-patterns

### 3. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated Development Workflow

Replaced verbose "Planning-First Development" section with:
- 5-step workflow aligned with new lean template
- Benefits of the new structure
- Reference to `docs/_active/README.md` for details
- Complete example planning doc (PDF Upload feature)

---

## Decisions Made During Implementation

1. **Keep execution.md as-is**: execution.md works well for tracking implementation progress; no changes needed
2. **Create annex directory structure**: Use `docs/features/[feature-name]/` for feature-specific deep dives (not implemented yet, just documented)
3. **Add execution doc for this work**: Following user's global instructions to always create execution docs for significant changes

---

## Files Modified

- `docs/_active/planning.md` - Complete rewrite (77 lines)
- `docs/_active/README.md` - New file (205 lines)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated Development Workflow section (lines 164-282)

---

## Workflow Benefits

✅ **planning.md stays lean (1 page)** - Easy to scan, quick to update
✅ **Cross-session continuity** - New agents/humans get up to speed fast
✅ **Human-friendly** - Designed for quick human updates between sessions
✅ **Decision tracking** - Decisions Log captures "why" with dates & 1-way/2-way flags
✅ **Opt-in detail** - Deep specs in annexes, not cluttering main doc

---

## User Feedback

User provided example template and requested:
- "lean, 1-page planning template that keeps only the essentials for cross-session continuity"
- "more alive for human input"
- Deep details moved to optional annexes

All requirements met ✅

---

## Follow-Up Tasks

- [ ] Create first feature-specific annex when needed (example: `docs/features/pdf-upload/context.md`)
- [ ] Update Husky post-commit hook to handle new structure (if needed)
- [ ] Test workflow with next feature implementation

---

## Lessons Learned

- Keeping planning docs lean (1 page) improves cross-session handoffs
- Decisions Log with 1-way/2-way flags helps understand rollback feasibility
- Open Questions with owners ensures nothing gets lost between sessions
- Annexes prevent "planning doc bloat" while preserving deep detail when needed

---

## Notes

This update aligns with user's global instructions to create execution docs for significant changes. The new structure should significantly improve cross-session continuity for both humans and agents.
