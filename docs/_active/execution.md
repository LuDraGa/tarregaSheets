## Progress Log

### 2025-01-15 10:00 AM

- ✅ Created backend Pydantic model
- ✅ Created API endpoint skeleton
- ⏳ Working on business logic in service layer
- **Blocker**: Need clarification on MongoDB schema design
  - Question: Embedded documents or references?
  - Decision: Using embedded for tight coupling (approved by user)

### 2025-01-15 2:00 PM

- ✅ Completed business logic
- ✅ Added unit tests (95% coverage)
- ⏳ Starting frontend TypeScript types
- **Note**: Discovered edge case with empty input; added validation

### 2025-01-15 4:30 PM

- ✅ Created frontend components
- ✅ Integrated with backend API
- ⏳ Testing with sample data
- **Issue**: CORS error in local dev
  - Fix: Added frontend origin to CORS middleware in `main.py`

### 2025-01-15 6:00 PM

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Manual testing complete
- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ Feature working in production
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Decisions Made During Implementation

1. **MongoDB Schema**: Used embedded documents for versions (tight coupling)
2. **Error Handling**: Return 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors
3. **Frontend State**: Used React Query for API state (easier caching)
4. **File Upload**: MongoDB GridFS for now; migrate to S3 later if needed

## Bugs & Fixes

| Bug | Severity | Fix | Commit |
|-----|----------|-----|--------|
| CORS error in local dev | Medium | Added CORS middleware | abc123 |
| Empty input crashes parser | High | Added validation | def456 |
| Slow rendering for 100+ items | Low | Added virtualization | ghi789 |

## Code Locations

- Backend models: `backend/app/models/example.py`
- Backend routes: `backend/app/routes/example.py`
- Backend services: `backend/app/services/example.py`
- Frontend types: `frontend/src/types/example.ts`
- Frontend components: `frontend/src/components/Example/`

---

## Performance Metrics

- API response time: 50 ms (avg)
- Frontend render time: 30 ms (avg)
- Bundle size impact: +15 KB (acceptable)

---

## Testing Results

- Unit tests: 25/25 passing
- Integration tests: 10/10 passing
- Manual testing: All scenarios verified
- Cross-browser: Chrome ✅, Firefox ✅, Safari ✅

---

## Follow-Up Tasks

- [ ] Refactor service layer for better testability (technical debt)
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright (future)
- [ ] Optimize MongoDB queries (if performance degrades)
- [ ] Add caching for expensive operations (future optimization)

---

## Lessons Learned

- Always test CORS in local dev before deploying
- Validate input early to avoid cascading errors
- React Query makes API state management much easier
- Virtualization is essential for long lists

---

## Notes

- Feature delivered on time
- User feedback: "Works great, very intuitive"
- Ready for next phase
